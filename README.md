# Arduino_UNO-Line-Follower-Robot
The line fallowing robot is one of the self-operating robots. That detects and fallows a line drawn on the area. The line is indicated by white line on a block surface or block line on a white surface. This system must be sense by the line. This application is depends upon the sensors. Here we are using two sensors for path detection purpose. That is proximity sensor and IR sensor. The proximity sensor used for path detection and IR sensor used for obstacle detection. These sensors mounted at front end of the robot. The microcontroller is an intelligent device the whole circuit is controlled by the microcontroller.
